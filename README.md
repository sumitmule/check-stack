# CheckStack

This project was developed as a part of ACM Enigma Hackathon, VIIT.
<br>
Domain : EdTech

When people are starting off with a project they tend to get confused ðŸ¤” about choosing the correct tech stack. To solve this problem we collected data about famous technologies and analysed it.
We a built a website that asks users about their skills, project requirements such as scalability, time duration etc. and team details if any. Depending on all these factor the website suggests the best tech stack that can get the project done.

### Tech/Framework used :
1. Language : Python
2. Framework : Flask
3. Library : pickle, pandas

> The data collected for each domain was analysed and stored into pickle files so that it can be referenced from python files. ðŸ“‚

### Things implemented in this project : 
- Getting more familiar with Flask
- Use of pkl files

> This problem statement can be solved in a better way by feeding a large data related to these tech stacks to a machine learning model and then using that model to provide users with better answers.
